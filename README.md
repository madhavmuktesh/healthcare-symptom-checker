    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` root and add the following variables:
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
    ```
4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend

## Challenges & Learnings

*(This is a great section to show your thought process!)*

A key challenge was ensuring secure and efficient communication between the React frontend and the Node.js backend. This was solved by implementing a JWT-based authentication flow. On the frontend, an Axios interceptor was used to automatically attach the authorization token to every protected API request, which simplified the code in the components and centralized the authentication logic. Another challenge was designing the LLM prompt to return a consistent JSON structure, which was crucial for reliably parsing and displaying the data in the UI.
